Welcome to **photos.ashwath.ch**, a clean and simple photo gallery where I showcase my photography. The website displays a grid of my photos, each in identical thumbnails. When you click on a thumbnail, it expands to reveal the full-size image in its original aspect ratio.

## Run it yourself!

To get started with photos.ashwath.ch, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/photos.ashwath.ch
cd photos.ashwath.ch
npm install
```
# Customize it!
To customize photos.ashwath.ch, you can change the images in the 'src/assets` directory. Simply add or remove images, and the site will automatically update to reflect your changes.
